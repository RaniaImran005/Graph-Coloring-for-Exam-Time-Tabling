# Graph-Coloring-for-Exam-Time-Tabling
This project tackles the Exam Timetabling Problem by automating conflict-free exam schedules using graph coloring. Exam clashes are modeled as a graph and solved using a fast Greedy algorithm and an optimized Tabu Search. Results compare speed, solution quality, reduced time slots, and lower student stress.
